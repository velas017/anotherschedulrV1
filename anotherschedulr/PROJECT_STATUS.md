## üìç Last Session Summary

**Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Duration**: Extended session  
**Focus**: Mobile Responsive Calendar & Preview System Implementation

### What Was Accomplished
1. ‚úÖ **MAJOR FEATURE: Mobile-Responsive Calendar Layout**
   - **IMPLEMENTED RESPONSIVE GRID SYSTEM**: Calendar now stacks vertically on mobile devices (calendar top, times below)
   - **PRESERVED DESKTOP LAYOUT**: Side-by-side layout maintained for desktop users (calendar left, times right)
   - **RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS**: Uses Tailwind's `lg:grid-cols-2` for proper mobile-first design
   - **USER EXPERIENCE**: Mobile users now get intuitive top-to-bottom booking flow
   - **TECHNICAL**: Updated grid system from fixed side-by-side to responsive layout

2. ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FEATURE: Preview Device Simulation**
   - **PREVIEW SYSTEM**: Mobile/desktop toggle in scheduling page builder now affects Calendar layout
   - **DYNAMIC LAYOUT**: Calendar responds to preview device selection, not just viewport size
   - **PROP-BASED CONTROL**: Added `previewDevice` prop to Calendar component for manual layout control
   - **USER TESTING**: Business owners can now see exactly how customers will experience mobile booking
   - **TECHNICAL**: Conditional grid classes based on preview device selection

3. ‚úÖ **TWO-STEP TIME SELECTION IMPLEMENTATION**
   - **IMPROVED UX**: Time slot selection now requires confirmation with "Select and continue" dropdown
   - **PRECISE POSITIONING**: Dropdown appears directly below selected time slot (not at bottom)
   - **VISUAL FEEDBACK**: Selected time slots are highlighted in black before confirmation
   - **MOBILE OPTIMIZED**: Confirmation system works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop layouts

4. ‚úÖ **CALENDAR COMPONENT ENHANCEMENT**
   - **INTERFACE EXTENSION**: Added optional `previewDevice?: 'desktop' | 'mobile'` prop
   - **BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: Calendar works in both preview mode and public booking pages
   - **LAYOUT LOGIC**: Smart grid system that adapts to preview mode or responsive breakpoints
   - **CODE QUALITY**: Clean implementation maintaining existing functionality

3. ‚úÖ **Complete Calendar & Time Selection Implementation** (Previously Completed)
   - Built interactive Calendar component with month navigation and date selection
   - Created availability API endpoint (`/api/public/[userId]/availability`) for real-time time slot checking
   - Implemented service duration-based time slot generation (15-minute intervals)
   - Added conflict detection with existing appointments for accurate availability

2. ‚úÖ **Complete Booking Flow Integration**
   - Extended public booking page with Categories ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Calendar navigation
   - Added service summary display during date/time selection
   - Implemented proper state management across all booking views
   - Integrated Calendar component into scheduling page builder preview

3. ‚úÖ **Availability API System**
   - Fixed critical type error in availability API (removed invalid `.toLocaleLowerCase()`)
   - Added robust business hours parsing with JSON string handling
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling and fallback to default hours
   - Added timezone support and proper date handling

4. ‚úÖ **Session Context & Preview Fixes**
   - Added session context to scheduling page builder component
   - Fixed preview mode using actual user ID instead of "preview-user"
   - Updated booking URLs and embed codes to use real user data
   - Added loading states to prevent invalid API calls

5. ‚úÖ **Business Hours Calendar Integration - CRITICAL FIX**
   - Created `/api/public/[userId]/business-hours` endpoint for calendar business hours fetching
   - Added `isClosedDate()` helper function to detect closed business days
   - Updated date selection logic to prevent clicking on closed days (Sunday/Saturday)
   - Implemented proper visual styling - closed days now appear grayed out like past dates
   - Added loading states for business hours fetching

### Issues Resolved
- **‚úÖ MAJOR UX ISSUE RESOLVED**: Mobile calendar layout - calendar now stacks vertically on mobile devices
- **‚úÖ PREVIEW SYSTEM FIXED**: Mobile/desktop preview toggle now properly affects calendar layout
- **‚úÖ TIME SELECTION UX IMPROVED**: Added two-step confirmation system with "Select and continue" dropdown
- **‚úÖ POSITIONING BUG FIXED**: Confirmation dropdown now appears directly below selected time slot
- **‚úÖ RESPONSIVE DESIGN COMPLETED**: Calendar works perfectly on all screen sizes with proper breakpoints
- **‚úÖ COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE**: Calendar component now supports both preview mode and responsive design

### ‚úÖ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED  
**‚úÖ TIMEZONE DOUBLE-BOOKING VULNERABILITY ELIMINATED**
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed backwards timezone conversion that allowed double-booking
- **SECURITY**: Eliminated ability for customers to book conflicting appointments  
- **RELIABILITY**: Time slot conflict detection now works correctly across all timezones
- **BUSINESS IMPACT**: Prevents scheduling chaos and customer service issues
- **TECHNICAL**: Proper UTC alignment between slots and existing appointments
- **VALIDATION**: 10:00-11:30 AM appointment now properly blocks those time slots

**‚úÖ CALENDAR CLOSED DAY SELECTION FIXED**
- Closed business days (Sunday/Saturday) now appear grayed out and are non-clickable
- Visual consistency with past dates - same styling for all unavailable dates
- Users can no longer accidentally select dates when business is closed
- Eliminates confusion of seeing "No available times" after clicking closed days
- Calendar now perfectly respects business hours configuration

### Next Steps Identified
- **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Implement booking confirmation flow after date/time selection
- Create appointment submission API endpoint for public bookings  
- Add form validation and error handling for booking process
- Test complete end-to-end booking flow with real appointment data
- Add email notifications for new bookings (customer + business owner)
- Add calendar drag-and-drop rescheduling functionality  
- Add calendar keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Implement recurring appointment scheduling
- Add more customization options to scheduling page builder (colors, branding)

## üîß Technical Debt & TODOs

### High Priority
1. **Database**: Add composite indexes for tenant-scoped queries
2. **Security**: Implement full CSP headers
3. **Performance**: Optimize N+1 queries in public APIs
4. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
5. **Monitoring**: Implement error tracking (Sentry)

### Medium Priority
1. **Code**: Clean up remaining TypeScript `any` types
2. **UI**: Improve mobile responsiveness
3. **API**: Standardize error response format
4. **Docs**: API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
5. **Build**: Optimize bundle size

### Low Priority
1. **Refactor**: Extract common UI patterns to components
2. **Style**: Create consistent color palette system
3. **i18n**: Add internationalization support
4. **A11y**: Complete WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
5. **DevX**: Add pre-commit hooks

## üéì Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **Next.js 15 App Router** | Modern React patterns, better performance, built-in API routes | 2025-01 |
| **Prisma ORM** | Type safety, excellent DX, migration management | 2025-01 |
| **SQLite for Dev** | Zero config, easy local development | 2025-01 |
| **PostgreSQL for Prod** | Scalability, row-level security, partitioning support | 2025-01 |
| **Tailwind CSS v4** | Utility-first, consistent design system, smaller bundles | 2025-01 |
| **NextAuth.js** | Robust auth solution, OAuth support, database sessions | 2025-01 |
| **Zod Validation** | Runtime type checking, schema validation | 2025-08 |
| **In-Memory Rate Limiting** | Simple for MVP, can upgrade to Redis later | 2025-08 |
| **Hourly Calendar Grid** | Better UX for appointment scheduling, cleaner view | 2025-08 |

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Prisma Imports**: Always use named imports `{ prisma }` not default imports
2. **Tenant Isolation**: Every query must filter by `userId` for multi-tenancy
3. **TypeScript**: Avoid `any` types - use `Record<string, unknown>` for objects
4. **Calendar Positioning**: Pixel-based calculations work best for precise times
5. **Security**: Never trust client input - always validate and sanitize
6. **Performance**: Connection pooling critical for database-heavy operations
