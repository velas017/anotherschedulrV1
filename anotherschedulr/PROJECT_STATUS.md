## 📍 Last Session Summary

**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Duration**: Extended session  
**Focus**: Complete Calendar & Time Selection Feature + Business Hours Integration

### What Was Accomplished
1. ✅ **Complete Calendar & Time Selection Implementation**
   - Built interactive Calendar component with month navigation and date selection
   - Created availability API endpoint (`/api/public/[userId]/availability`) for real-time time slot checking
   - Implemented service duration-based time slot generation (15-minute intervals)
   - Added conflict detection with existing appointments for accurate availability

2. ✅ **Complete Booking Flow Integration**
   - Extended public booking page with Categories → Services → Calendar navigation
   - Added service summary display during date/time selection
   - Implemented proper state management across all booking views
   - Integrated Calendar component into scheduling page builder preview

3. ✅ **Availability API System**
   - Fixed critical type error in availability API (removed invalid `.toLocaleLowerCase()`)
   - Added robust business hours parsing with JSON string handling
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling and fallback to default hours
   - Added timezone support and proper date handling

4. ✅ **Session Context & Preview Fixes**
   - Added session context to scheduling page builder component
   - Fixed preview mode using actual user ID instead of "preview-user"
   - Updated booking URLs and embed codes to use real user data
   - Added loading states to prevent invalid API calls

5. ✅ **Business Hours Calendar Integration - CRITICAL FIX**
   - Created `/api/public/[userId]/business-hours` endpoint for calendar business hours fetching
   - Added `isClosedDate()` helper function to detect closed business days
   - Updated date selection logic to prevent clicking on closed days (Sunday/Saturday)
   - Implemented proper visual styling - closed days now appear grayed out like past dates
   - Added loading states for business hours fetching

### Issues Resolved
- **RESOLVED**: Calendar closed day selection issue - users can no longer select unavailable business days
- **RESOLVED**: Availability API type errors preventing proper time slot loading
- **RESOLVED**: Preview component using fake user ID causing 404 errors
- **RESOLVED**: Inconsistent component behavior between preview and live booking
- **RESOLVED**: Missing business hours enforcement in calendar UI

### ✅ CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED
**✅ CALENDAR CLOSED DAY SELECTION FIXED**
- Closed business days (Sunday/Saturday) now appear grayed out and are non-clickable
- Visual consistency with past dates - same styling for all unavailable dates
- Users can no longer accidentally select dates when business is closed
- Eliminates confusion of seeing "No available times" after clicking closed days
- Calendar now perfectly respects business hours configuration

### Next Steps Identified
- Implement booking confirmation flow after date/time selection
- Add calendar drag-and-drop rescheduling functionality
- Enhance mobile responsiveness for calendar interface
- Add calendar keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Implement recurring appointment scheduling

## 🔧 Technical Debt & TODOs

### High Priority
1. **Database**: Add composite indexes for tenant-scoped queries
2. **Security**: Implement full CSP headers
3. **Performance**: Optimize N+1 queries in public APIs
4. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
5. **Monitoring**: Implement error tracking (Sentry)

### Medium Priority
1. **Code**: Clean up remaining TypeScript `any` types
2. **UI**: Improve mobile responsiveness
3. **API**: Standardize error response format
4. **Docs**: API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
5. **Build**: Optimize bundle size

### Low Priority
1. **Refactor**: Extract common UI patterns to components
2. **Style**: Create consistent color palette system
3. **i18n**: Add internationalization support
4. **A11y**: Complete WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
5. **DevX**: Add pre-commit hooks

## 🎓 Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **Next.js 15 App Router** | Modern React patterns, better performance, built-in API routes | 2025-01 |
| **Prisma ORM** | Type safety, excellent DX, migration management | 2025-01 |
| **SQLite for Dev** | Zero config, easy local development | 2025-01 |
| **PostgreSQL for Prod** | Scalability, row-level security, partitioning support | 2025-01 |
| **Tailwind CSS v4** | Utility-first, consistent design system, smaller bundles | 2025-01 |
| **NextAuth.js** | Robust auth solution, OAuth support, database sessions | 2025-01 |
| **Zod Validation** | Runtime type checking, schema validation | 2025-08 |
| **In-Memory Rate Limiting** | Simple for MVP, can upgrade to Redis later | 2025-08 |
| **Hourly Calendar Grid** | Better UX for appointment scheduling, cleaner view | 2025-08 |

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Prisma Imports**: Always use named imports `{ prisma }` not default imports
2. **Tenant Isolation**: Every query must filter by `userId` for multi-tenancy
3. **TypeScript**: Avoid `any` types - use `Record<string, unknown>` for objects
4. **Calendar Positioning**: Pixel-based calculations work best for precise times
5. **Security**: Never trust client input - always validate and sanitize
6. **Performance**: Connection pooling critical for database-heavy operations
