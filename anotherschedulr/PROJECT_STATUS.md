## üîß Technical Debt & TODOs

### High Priority
1. **Database**: Add composite indexes for tenant-scoped queries
2. **Security**: Implement full CSP headers
3. **Performance**: Optimize N+1 queries in public APIs
4. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
5. **Monitoring**: Implement error tracking (Sentry)

### Medium Priority
1. **Code**: Clean up remaining TypeScript `any` types
2. **UI**: Improve mobile responsiveness
3. **API**: Standardize error response format
4. **Docs**: API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
5. **Build**: Optimize bundle size

### Low Priority
1. **Refactor**: Extract common UI patterns to components
2. **Style**: Create consistent color palette system
3. **i18n**: Add internationalization support
4. **A11y**: Complete WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
5. **DevX**: Add pre-commit hooks

## üéì Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **Next.js 15 App Router** | Modern React patterns, better performance, built-in API routes | 2025-01 |
| **Prisma ORM** | Type safety, excellent DX, migration management | 2025-01 |
| **SQLite for Dev** | Zero config, easy local development | 2025-01 |
| **PostgreSQL for Prod** | Scalability, row-level security, partitioning support | 2025-01 |
| **Tailwind CSS v4** | Utility-first, consistent design system, smaller bundles | 2025-01 |
| **NextAuth.js** | Robust auth solution, OAuth support, database sessions | 2025-01 |
| **Zod Validation** | Runtime type checking, schema validation | 2025-08 |
| **In-Memory Rate Limiting** | Simple for MVP, can upgrade to Redis later | 2025-08 |
| **Hourly Calendar Grid** | Better UX for appointment scheduling, cleaner view | 2025-08 |

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Prisma Imports**: Always use named imports `{ prisma }` not default imports
2. **Tenant Isolation**: Every query must filter by `userId` for multi-tenancy
3. **TypeScript**: Avoid `any` types - use `Record<string, unknown>` for objects
4. **Calendar Positioning**: Pixel-based calculations work best for precise times
5. **Security**: Never trust client input - always validate and sanitize
6. **Performance**: Connection pooling critical for database-heavy operations
