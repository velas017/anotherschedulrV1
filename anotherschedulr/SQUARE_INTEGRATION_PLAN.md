# Square Payment Integration Plan
## Multi-Tenant Scheduling Application

> **Document Created**: August 10, 2025  
> **Status**: Planning Phase  
> **Feasibility**: ‚úÖ **Confirmed - Square fully supports multi-tenant applications**

---

## üìã Executive Summary

Square payment processing can be successfully integrated into your scheduling application, allowing each business owner (user) to:
- Connect their own Square merchant account
- Accept payments directly on their scheduling pages
- Receive payments directly to their bank account
- Maintain complete control over their payment processing

### Key Benefits
- **Per-User Accounts**: Each business owner has their own Square merchant account
- **Direct Deposits**: Payments go directly to user's bank account (not platform)
- **Competitive Rates**: 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction (electronic), 3.5% + $0.15 (manual entry)
- **No Platform Fees**: Users pay Square directly, not through your platform
- **Full Feature Set**: Supports cards, digital wallets, ACH, recurring payments
- **PCI Compliance**: Square handles all payment security requirements
- **Mobile Optimized**: Works seamlessly on all devices

        OAuth --> Tokens[Access Tokens]
        Tokens --> DB
    end
    
    SquareAPI --> Bank[Owner's Bank Account]
```

### OAuth Flow for Multi-Tenant Setup
1. Business owner clicks "Connect Square" in dashboard
2. Redirected to Square authorization page
3. Owner logs into their Square account
4. Grants permissions to your application
5. Square redirects back with authorization code
6. Exchange code for access tokens
7. Store encrypted tokens per user

### Payment Processing Flow
1. Customer selects service and appointment time
2. Enters payment information via Square Web SDK
3. Square generates secure payment token
4. Backend processes payment using owner's Square account
5. Appointment created with payment confirmation
6. Confirmation emails sent to both parties

## üìù Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Square OAuth Integration (Weeks 1-2)**

#### 1.1 Square Developer Setup
```
‚ñ° Create Square Developer account for platform
‚ñ° Register application in Square Developer Console
‚ñ° Obtain application ID and secret
‚ñ° Configure OAuth redirect URLs
‚ñ° Set up sandbox environment for testing
```

#### 1.2 Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add Square integration fields to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN square_access_token TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN square_refresh_token TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN square_merchant_id VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN square_location_id VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN square_connected_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN square_expires_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN payments_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Add pricing to services
ALTER TABLE services ADD COLUMN price DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE services ADD COLUMN deposit_amount DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE services ADD COLUMN payment_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Add payment tracking to appointments
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN payment_status VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN payment_id VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN amount_paid DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD COLUMN payment_date TIMESTAMP;
```

#### 1.3 OAuth Implementation
```typescript
// API Routes needed
POST   /api/square/connect       // Initiate OAuth flow
GET    /api/square/callback      // OAuth callback handler
GET    /api/square/status        // Check connection status
DELETE /api/square/disconnect    // Revoke Square access
POST   /api/square/refresh       // Refresh access token
```

---

### **Phase 2: Payment Processing Integration (Weeks 3-4)**

#### 2.1 Web Payments SDK Setup
```javascript
// Frontend: Initialize Square Web Payments SDK
const payments = Square.payments(applicationId, locationId);

// Create card payment method
const card = await payments.card();
await card.attach('#card-container');

// Generate payment token
const tokenResult = await card.tokenize();
```

#### 2.2 Payment API Endpoints
```typescript
// Payment processing endpoints
POST /api/payments/process
{
  token: string,          // Square payment token
  appointmentId: string,
  amount: number,
  customerId?: string
}

POST /api/payments/refund
{
  paymentId: string,
  amount?: number,        // Partial refund if specified
  reason: string
}

GET /api/payments/history
// Returns payment history for the user
```

#### 2.3 Webhook Handlers
```typescript
// Square webhook endpoints
POST /api/webhooks/square/payment
// Handle payment.created, payment.updated events

POST /api/webhooks/square/refund
// Handle refund.created, refund.updated events
```
